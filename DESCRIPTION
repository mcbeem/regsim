Description: This function provides a quick and convenient means for simulating data from 	a path diagram, fitting regression models to the simulated data, and appraising 	the model's performance with respect to a particular target parameter and its 		standard error. The function calculates the bias, coverage rate, RMSE, and 		analytical and 	empirical standard errors.
